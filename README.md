# About Passwords Quiz
## What I think about when I think about passwords.

### With your partner, in words both of you will understand 6 months from now, answer the following questions.

> What is identification?

like a username or id number - the method of finding out who is trying to get in - who are you?

> What is authentication?

a password or security question asking the user to prove they are who they say they are

> What is authorization?

if credentials are correct, authorization determines if the user has access to the requested files - it is a yes or no question of do you have permissions

> What is your opinion on how identification and authentication are currently implemented in the industry?

It seems like things are pretty lax - most usernames are emails which could make accounts much more vulnerable. Furthermore, the passwords the industry has made us accustom to are easily guessed by a computer and not very secure.

> What is your password?

> If a customer asked for a set of rules for appropriate passwords, what advice would you give them?

1) never use a one word password - even if it has dumb numb3r/$ymb0l substitutions
2) try using an easy to remember sentence with at least four words
3) though batman will rescue you in other scenarios, he is not your hero in password selection
4) try going to howsecureismypassword.net to see how secure your password is
5) don't use your birthday, hometown, kidsname, other easily accessible info as your password alone.
